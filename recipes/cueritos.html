    <h1>Tostadas de cueritos recipe</h1>
    <p>
      Tostadas are a staple of basic Mexican Food. Not only are they delicious,
      but like many other recipes, they are not complicated to make either. Like
      my mom says, the secret is in the seasoning, and I agree with her 100%,
      because even the most simple meal can be exquisite when it is made with
      love.
